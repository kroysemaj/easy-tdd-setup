# easy-tdd-setup

A new and improved simple seed TDD project set up with [Parcel](https://parceljs.org/) and [Jest](https://jestjs.io/). There are no other bells or whistles, just Parcel and Jest.

##Installation

You need [nodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/). From there:

1. Clone the project and run `npm install` in your terminal
1. Once the dependencies are downloaded, you're all set.
1. Run `npm test` to start the test watcher. Each time you save a `*.js` file, the watcher will find and run all tests.

If you want to add new files, add source files to the `javascript` folder and test files to the `spec` folder. Conventionally, your test files should end with `*.test.js` or `*.spec.js`, though this is not required.
